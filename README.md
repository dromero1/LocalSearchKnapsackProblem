# LocalSearchKnapsackProblem

Some local search approximations to the Pareto's front of a variant of the knapsack problem.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Usage

Run the console program as follows:

```
main
```

The program will start displaying the approximation results.
